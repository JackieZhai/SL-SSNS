# SL-SSNS
Official implementation of ["Addressing Distribution Mismatch for Effective Semi-Supervised Neuron Segmentation"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.26.595303v1) [under review].

## ðŸ§ª Demo: Subvolume Selection

To help users better understand and apply our method, we provide an interactive demo [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vPYYeaycpdQjDiu_TQD4LqQbjezf40yc) showcasing the **subvolume selection process** in both:

- ðŸ”¹ The **spatial domain**

- ðŸ”¹ The **embedding domain**

This demo can be readily adapted to your own EM datasets.
